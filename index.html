Hello to the ones reading this, my name is Brandon I'm 16 years old currently.
  I play volleyball, football, and indoor track for sports. I enjoy also doing a
  lot of physical activites such as going to the gym or just skateboarding. I
  have 2 birds and a sister. I also enjoy hanging out with my friends, playing
  guitar, playing video games and working at my job at Dunkins. I have plans to
  go to MIT which will be hard but I still have high ambitions but i also have
  other schools in mind like UMASS Amherst, Umass lowell ,Boston University,
  Tufts or any other good engineering college since i dream about becoming a
  Chemical Engineer or a Mechanical engineer and I also have an interist in
  Plastics and Aerospace. I have high hopes for the future and what it brings me
  and I am willing to put as much work as I can to achieve all I want.
